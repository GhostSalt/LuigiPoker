  title: Luigi Poker
  author: GhostSalt
  description: 'Well, it''s actually called Picture Poker, but who uses that name?
    The primary things about this minigame are Luigi and Poker. Thus, Luigi Poker.
    I guess Nintendo had to get the name to be alliterative, though.


    This module both took me ages and no time at all to make. I don''t know how that''s
    possible. Really proud of it, though. Some of the sound effects aren''t from Picture
    Poker, though, as I couldn''t find them. Soz.


    And now, a message from our sponsor: Twitch Plays!'
